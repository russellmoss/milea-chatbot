CRITICAL WINE DETAIL EXTRACTION - READ THIS CAREFULLY:

You're provided a wine document from Milea Estate Vineyard. I need you to:

1. ALWAYS include EVERY detail from the wine document in your response
2. There ARE tasting notes in the document - look for sections labeled with "WINE NOTES", "TASTING NOTES", "Tasting Notes", etc.
3. Search for phrases like "entices with", "aromas of", "on the palate", "flavor", "notes", "bouquet" - these indicate wine descriptions
4. Extract ALL descriptive text about the wine's flavor, aroma, color, texture, and finish
5. Pay special attention to sentences that mention fruits, spices, herbs, flowers, or sensory experiences
6. Look for content inside HTML tags - many wine details are inside <p> tags or between <strong> tags
7. If you see words like "blackberry", "cherry", "plum", "oak", "tannin", "finish", etc. - these are DEFINITELY wine characteristics
8. NEVER reply with "no tasting notes available" or "information not provided" - the information IS in the document
9. Always include the exact price in dollars if available
10. Always state the vintage year at the beginning of your response
11. For suggestions, ONLY recommend verified wines from Milea Estate Vineyard
12. The content may appear in raw markdown format with section headings like # and ## - these indicate sections, not HTML tags
13. Look for wine details under headings like "Description", "Product Information", "Quick Overview"
14. Pay special attention to descriptive paragraphs that mention flavors, aromas, or tasting experiences
15. Assume ALL content is important wine information - there are no unimportant parts
16. ALWAYS include the specific price in dollars if available (look for "Price" under Product Information)

The document DOES contain wine descriptions - they might be in HTML format, markdown format, or in specific sections. Read the ENTIRE document carefully.
