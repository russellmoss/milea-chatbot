## Wine Notes
**Wine Information **

Seyval blanc released in France in 1921 as a highly sustainable alternative to V. *vinifera* vines.  It quickly made it's way to New York State, who perfected the growing and vinification of this variety. 

This particular expression of Seyval blanc comes from old vines that were initially planted at Hudson Valley Vineyards (formerly Clinton Vineyards) in 1974.  As vines age, their vigor diminishes, making smaller canopies and lower yields.  In turn, the vine delivers fruit of incredible character and density of flavor and with this Seyval, it's no different. 

The fruit was harvested in October of 2023 and gently whole cluster pressed in order to maintain finesse.  The wine was fermented in stainless steel tanks at cool temperatures to retain the fruit expression and then carefully managed until bottling in March of 2024.  The result was a wine with a pure expression of it's natural terroir. 

**Tasting notes**

This old vine Seyval blanc brims with aromas of wet stone and kumquat.  On first sip, the wine opens with green apple, grapefruit and a hint of almond skin. The wine carries through with a focused line of acidity that finishes cleanly on the palate.

The old vine Clinton Vineyard Seyval blanc pair well with bright seafood such as oysters and ceviche or Greek lemon chicken.
