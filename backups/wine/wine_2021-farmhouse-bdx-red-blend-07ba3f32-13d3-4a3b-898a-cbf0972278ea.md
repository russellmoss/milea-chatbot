## Wine Notes
Experience the essence of New York's vinicultural excellence through our Farmhouse series, a testament to Milea Estate's commitment to sourcing the finest varieties from partner vineyards across the Empire State. Transformed by our skilled winemaking team, these wines embody the true spirit of New York's winemaking heritage. &nbsp; The 2021 Farmhouse BDX Red Blend takes center stage, artfully blending fruits primarily sourced from the Hudson River Region and Long Island. This lighter expression of a Bordeaux blend enthralls the senses with enticing aromas of black currant and black cherry, interwoven with delicate nuances of leather and a hint of violet. On the palate, its silky tannins meld seamlessly with a fresh acidity, unveiling a captivating interplay. As the wine evolves, it leaves a delightful, lingering finish of vibrant acidity and subtle notes of cola. &nbsp; Pairing Recommendation: Enhance the charm of our Farmhouse BDX with remarkable culinary companions such as Korean BBQ, Chef David Kim's mouthwatering wagyu sliders, steak tartare, or a paella. Our general manager finds particular joy in pairing it with the tantalizing flavors of tacos al pastor.
