## Wine Notes
In 2023, upstate New York experienced a severe frost, which dramatically lowered yields. Consequently, this allowed us to source more fruit from our trusted vineyard partners on Long Island, which wasn't impacted by the frost.


## Tasting Notes
The 2023 Reserve Chardonnay opens with aromas of vanilla and pear.  It follows through on the palate with a salinity that is indicative of Long Island Chardonnay, a medium body and tannins to compliment.  The wine finishes with spiced apple, vanilla, and a mouthwatering acidity.
