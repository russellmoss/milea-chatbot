## Wine Notes
The 2022 Reserve Cabernet Franc, a distinguished blend from Milea Estate, exemplifies the pinnacle of dedication and craftsmanship. Sourced from our esteemed Sang's Vineyard in the Hudson Valley, along with two of our partnering vineyards on Long Island, this wine represents the collaborative spirit of excellence. Meticulous care is taken at Milea to maintain Sang's Vineyard at peak performance, ensuring a true expression of its unique terroir. Our General Manager, an international viticulture consultant and former Cornell professor, works closely with our Long Island partners to grow grapes to our exacting standards. The result is a wine that embodies the principles of devotion: "Great wine requires devotionâ€”to the land, family, friends, the community, and progress." Each bottle reflects our unwavering commitment to tradition, winemaking, and the bonds of kinship and community.


## Tasting Notes
Opulent aromas of ripe plums, black currants, and blackberries that captivate the senses. Emanating from behind the fruit, notes of brooding ink, graphite, and delicate vanilla unfold, adding depth to this magnificent wine. On the palate, a harmonious blend of dried herbs, cola, and black fruits create a luscious, full-bodied experience, culminating in a finish adorned with nuances of tobacco, spice, and dried lavender.
