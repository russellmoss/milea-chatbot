Farm

[Book a Private tour](https://mileaestatevineyard.com/private-tour-tasting/)

Despite the hum of activity in the tasting room and vineyard, Milea Estate is a place of peace and tranquility. Our 102-acre property includes meadows and a pond, and is surrounded by woods. We keep horses and maintain organic gardens and a greenhouse. In our orchard, we grow a dozen apple varieties, as well as plums, peaches, and pears. We believe that biological diversity is a key aspect of sustainability.

We are proud to sustainably farm New York State Grown & Certified vines. We’ve selected grape varieties based upon their compatibility with our soils and climate so that our farming methods can be as low-impact as possible. Our plants are tightly spaced; the competition for water and nutrients makes for deep roots and characterful fruit.

## Our Grape Varieties

Our hillside plantings include three acres of Cabernet Franc, a noble variety in Bordeaux and the Loire Valley. We also grow the legendary Austrian white, Grüner Veltliner, and Blaufränkisch, a highly regarded red grape in Germany and central Europe. Rounding out our primary plantings are two heirloom varieties: the French-American Traminette, and the German-American Regent.

## Exploring  
New York  
Terroir

In addition to hand-harvesting our own grapes, we partner with small, sustainably farmed vineyards in other winegrowing regions of New York State, including Long Island and Lake Erie. This exploration of our state’s terroir allows us to vinify grape varieties we find interesting but which do not thrive in the unique ecosystem here in the Hudson River Valley.
