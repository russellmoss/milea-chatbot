# Soils of Milea Estate Vineyard

## Overview
- The vineyard sits on the Dutchess-Cardigan soil complex in the Hudson Valley
- This specific soil composition provides a rare balance of water retention and drainage
- Located on the shoulder and crest of hills with convex slopes for even exposure
- Unique geological features directly influence wine characteristics

## Soil Composition
- **Primary Formation**: Loamy till derived from phyllite, slate, schist, and shale
- **Dutchess Component**: 40% of vineyard soils
- **Cardigan Component**: 30% of vineyard soils
- **Structure**: Transitions from silt loam at surface to channery silt loam below

## Dutchess Soil Properties
- **Depth**: Extends beyond 80 inches
- **Water Transmissibility**: Moderately high to high (0.57 to 1.98 in/hr)
- **Available Water Supply**: Approximately 9.6 inches in the root zone
- **Benefits**: Allows extraordinary root penetration potential
- **Structure**: Progressive resistance encourages purposeful vine struggle

## Cardigan Soil Properties
- **Depth**: Shallower, 20-40 inches to bedrock
- **Water Transmissibility**: Lower (0.00 to 0.06 in/hr)
- **Structure**: Channery loam
- **Contribution**: Creates pockets of different growing conditions throughout the vineyard

## Impact on Wine Characteristics
- Creates balanced tension between hydration and stress for vines
- Encourages deep root penetration, resulting in wines with superior depth and complexity
- Particularly evident in Sang's Cabernet Franc, displaying remarkable structure
- Imparts a distinctive mineral imprint unique to Milea Estate wines
- Contributes to greater mid-palate weight compared to wines from other regions

## Comparative Terroir
- **Hudson Valley (Milea)**: Structured depth, balanced minerality, complex mid-palate
- **Long Island**: Brighter, more explosive fruitiness but often lacking structural depth
- Milea occasionally sources fruit from Long Island to bring brightness to blends
- The distinctive characteristics of Hudson Valley terroir provide the backbone of Milea's portfolio

## Drainage and Exposure
- Hillside position enhances natural drainage qualities
- Prevents problematic water accumulation while allowing vines to access moisture during dry periods
- Convex slopes ensure even sun exposure
- Eliminates water pockets that could dilute flavor concentration

## Viticultural Advantages
- Creates ideal conditions for Cabernet Franc and Central European varieties like Blaufrankisch and Gruner Veltliner
- Allows vines to draw nutrients from ancient rock formations
- Results in wines that authentically reflect the Hudson Valley's distinctive geological heritage
