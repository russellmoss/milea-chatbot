## Description
<p><strong>Vintage information</strong></p>
<p>Being a warm and dry year, 2020 was the ideal vintage for red wine in New York State.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fruit for our 2020 Pinot Noir was sourced from one of our partner growers in the Niagara Escarpment AVA, an appellation which has distinguished itself for high quality Pinot Noir.&nbsp; The fruit was hand harvested at optimal physiological ripeness to ensure structural integrity of the berries were maintained from vineyard to cellar.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wine information</strong></p>
<p>The wine was made using Burgundian techniques such as cold soaks, twice daily punch downs and 14 months of aging in neutral oak in order to fully express the nuanced beauty of the natual terroir from which the fruit originated.&nbsp; This resulted in an elegant and delicate expression of Pinot Noir with notes of forest floor and raspberries.&nbsp; The acidity is bright and the tannins are light.&nbsp;</p>

## Quick Overview
