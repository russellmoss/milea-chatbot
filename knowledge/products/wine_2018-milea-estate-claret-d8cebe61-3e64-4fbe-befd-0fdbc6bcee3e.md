## Description
<p>Made by New York's best Cabernet Sauvignon Winery*</p>
<p><strong>Vintage information</strong></p>
<p>The 2018 growing season was warmer than average, producing fruit of distinct character.&nbsp; The ripening season was quite rainy, which restrained sugar accumulation.&nbsp; Our vineyard team was able pinpoint the optimal time at which to harvest in order to produce the most expressive Bordeaux blends of 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wine information</strong></p>
<p>Our claret is a blend of Bordeaux grapes with 45% being made up of Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% of Merlot and 10% coming from Cabernet Franc.&nbsp; The fruit was primarily sourced from Long Island.&nbsp; Long Island presents an interesting terroir for New York, with sandy soils that drain rapidly, leading to Bordeaux reds of density, but with the refinement provided by New York's unique grapegrowing climate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2018 Milea Claret overflows with aromas of plum and blackberries.&nbsp; Those gorgeous fruit aromas are framed by earthy undertones and some baking spices.&nbsp; The tannins are refined and velvetty.&nbsp; The finish is long with balanced acidity.&nbsp;</p>
