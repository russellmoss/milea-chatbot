## Description
<p><strong>Wine Information</strong></p>
<p>This wine is a blend of the cool climate grape varieties&nbsp;<span class="il">Burdin</span>&nbsp;6055 and Chambourcin that came to upstate New York by 1960. Both varieties are fungus disease resistant, winter hardy, and productive.&nbsp;<span class="il">Burdin</span>&nbsp;6055 was bred before 1945 by Joanny&nbsp;<span class="il">Burdin</span>&nbsp;of the Sa&ocirc;ne-et-Loire Department in Burgundy, France. Chambourcin was bred by Joannes Seyve by 1960 in an area just south of Lyon, France. This supple and aromatic red wine has hints strawberry jam and red raspberries, with floral elements of violets and licorice. It is a complex and layered wine with a clean and soft tannin finish. This is one of the first commercially produced&nbsp;<span class="il">Burdin</span>&nbsp;wines in the United States.&nbsp;<span class="il">Burdin</span>&nbsp;Noir has been an overlooked grape variety that we hope can emerge into prominence on the East Coast.</p>
