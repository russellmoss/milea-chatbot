## Description
<p><strong>Wine Information&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Seyval blanc released in France in 1921 as a highly sustainable alternative to V. <em>vinifera</em> vines.&nbsp; It quickly made it's way to New York State, who perfected the growing and vinification of this variety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This particular expression of Seyval blanc comes from old vines that were initially planted at Hudson Valley Vineyards (formerly Clinton Vineyards) in 1974.&nbsp; As vines age, their vigor diminishes, making smaller canopies and lower yields.&nbsp; In turn, the vine delivers fruit of incredible character and density of flavor and with this Seyval, it's no different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fruit was harvested in October of 2023 and gently whole cluster pressed in order to maintain finesse.&nbsp; The wine was fermented in stainless steel tanks at cool temperatures to retain the fruit expression and then carefully managed until bottling in March of 2024.&nbsp; The result was a wine with a pure expression of it's natural terroir.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tasting notes</strong></p>
<p>This old vine Seyval blanc brims with aromas of wet stone and kumquat.&nbsp; On first sip, the wine opens with green apple, grapefruit and a hint of almond skin. The wine carries through with a focused line of acidity that finishes cleanly on the palate.</p>
<p>The old vine Clinton Vineyard Seyval blanc pair well with bright seafood such as oysters and ceviche or Greek lemon chicken.&nbsp;</p>
