## Description
<p><strong>Vintage information</strong></p>
<p>The 2019 vintage started a couple weeks later than average and was generally cool, favoring acid retention.&nbsp; This was spectacular for the white wines of New York state, as acidity is crucial to the production of desirable white wines.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wine information</strong></p>
<p>At Milea Estate, we believe in preserving the natural terroir of our great state.&nbsp; With this in mind, our Reserve Chardonnay was made in a minimal interventionist style.&nbsp; The grapes were harvetsed in the first half of October and fermented in 100% neutral French oak barrels.&nbsp; The wine is barrel fermented in order to bring more volume to compliment the crisp acidity and minerality.&nbsp; The wines are aged in barrel for 12 - 13 months prior to bottling.&nbsp; The result: a wine with vibrant pear, apples and a bright acidity.&nbsp; The minerality of our glacially derived soils is readily apparent in this expression of Chardonnay, providing you with what we call "<em>la belle salive</em>".&nbsp; Our Reserve Chardonnay is a chameleon with food pairings.&nbsp; It works well with most dishes, but we particularly enjoy it with seafood like crab, mussels and lobster.&nbsp;</p>
