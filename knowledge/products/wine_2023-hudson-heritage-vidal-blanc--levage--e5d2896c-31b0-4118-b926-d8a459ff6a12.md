## Description
<p><strong>Vineyard Notes</strong></p>
<p>In 2023, upstate New York experienced a severe frost which lowered yields dramatically. Consequently, this allowed the plants to concentrate their energy into the low yields and produce fruit of dramatic character.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Winemaking Notes</strong></p>
<p>The fruit was gently whole cluster pressed in order to maximize freshness and flavor and aroma. The juice was cold settled and fermented in stainless steel tanks. The juice was then racked to French oak barrels (10% new) and fermented. The wine then underwent a partial malolactic fermentation and 10 months of barrel aging prior to bottling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tasting Notes</strong></p>
<p>The 2023 Vidal blanc &Eacute;levage benefitted greatly from time in barrel. The barrel fermentations and aging subdued the aromas of citrus and pear and gave way to aromas of almond skin and pistachios. The wine has a medium body and a fresh acidity that lasts upon the finish.</p>

## Quick Overview
Experience the Vidal Blanc Élevage, where barrel fermentation and aging have transformed aromas of citrus and pear into rich notes of toasted nuts and vanilla.
