## Description
<p><strong>Vintage information</strong></p>
<p>2020 was an ideal vintage for New York State, with alot of beneficial warm and dry weather that allowed for the accumlation of flavors.&nbsp; This was no exception for the 2020 Chardonnay, which has gone on to garner the accolade as being New York's best Chardonnay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wine information&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The fruit was destemmed and pressed prior to being cold settled and then entirely fermented in neutral oak barrels at ambient temperatures.&nbsp; This allowed the wine to gain structure without aromatic influence from the oak.&nbsp; The winemaking team believes that this style of winemaking allows for the natural terroir to shine through more clearly, delivering a "sense of place" with each glass.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The wine possesses a minerality that is reminiscent of the glacially derived soils within which the vines are grown.&nbsp; The aromas of almond, lemon zest and pear arise from the glass and give way to a refreshing minerally acidity and medium body on the palate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This wine is a winemaker favorite at Milea Estate and we're sure you'll love it too.&nbsp;</p>
