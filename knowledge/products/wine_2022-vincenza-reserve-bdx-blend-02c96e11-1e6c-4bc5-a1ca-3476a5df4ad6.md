## Description
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Devotion series proudly showcases the pinnacle of winemaking, emphasizing meticulous farming practices and the transformation of select grape lots into exceptional expressions. Named after our founder Barry Milea's late mother, Vincenza, this Bordeaux blend takes center stage, showcasing the artful marriage of Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Petit Verdot. The majority of Cabernet Franc hails from the esteemed Sang's Vineyard, with additional fruit sourced from our vineyards on the enchanting North Fork of Long Island.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let the brightness of red cherries and the depth of brooding black currant captivate your senses as you delve into Vincenza's enticing bouquet. Silky tannins gracefully intertwine with a vibrant acidity on the palate, unveiling a symphony of red fruit flavors and delicate hints of vanilla that linger on the finish, delighting the most discerning palates.</span></p>

<p><strong>Pairing Recommendation:</strong></p>

Additionally, revel in the harmonious flavors that emerge when paired with classic bolognese and other savory meat-based pasta sauces.</span></p>
