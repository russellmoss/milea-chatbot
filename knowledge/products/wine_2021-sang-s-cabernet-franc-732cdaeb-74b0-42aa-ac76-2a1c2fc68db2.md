## Description
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our Devotion series, we unveil our unwavering commitment to exceptional winemaking, showcasing the most extraordinary expressions derived from select grape lots. Named after one of our founders, Sang Milea, Sang's Vineyard exemplifies our devotion to high-touch farming and winemaking practices, ensuring wines of unparalleled excellence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meticulous cultivation techniques cultivate small, concentrated berries with a symphony of flavors and phenolics. Hand-harvested and handled with utmost delicacy, the fruit undergoes malolactic fermentation in French oak barrels, carefully chosen to enhance the wine's savory character, round the tannins, and craft a wine destined for age-worthy greatness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indulge in the opulent aromas of ripe plums, black currants, and blackberries that captivate the senses. Emanating from behind the fruit, notes of brooding ink, graphite, and delicate vanilla unfold, adding depth to this magnificent wine. On the palate, a harmonious blend of dried herbs, cola, and black fruits create a luscious, full-bodied experience, culminating in a finish adorned with nuances of tobacco, spice, and dried lavender. True to its namesake, this wine embodies elegance and a quietly powerful presence.</span></p>
