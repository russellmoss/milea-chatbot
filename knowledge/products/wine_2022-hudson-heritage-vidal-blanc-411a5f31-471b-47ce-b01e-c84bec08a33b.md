<p>This Vidal blanc is a part of our Hudson Heritage series, which seeks to explore the grapes that have been grown in the Hudson Valley for nearly 100 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 2022 Vidal Blanc aromas are that of citrus blossoms and Bartlett Pear.&nbsp; On the palate, it has a medium body and a refreshing acidity with a fascinating minerality.&nbsp; Flavors of stone fruits begin to appear in the mouth and the finish is long.&nbsp; It is truly a special wine.&nbsp;</p>
