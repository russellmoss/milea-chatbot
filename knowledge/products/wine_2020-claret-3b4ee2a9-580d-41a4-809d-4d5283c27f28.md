## Description
<p><strong>Vintage information</strong></p>
<p>The 2020 vintage was ideal for reds in New York State, with mostly warm and dry weather throughout the season.&nbsp; This allowed the fruit to achieve physiological ripeness with optimal accumulation of flavors and phenolics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wine information</strong></p>
<p>Our Claret is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot.&nbsp; The grapes were destemmed and then put into tank prior to a 20% <em>Saign&eacute;e&nbsp;</em>in order to concentrate the skin-to-juice ratio.&nbsp; The fermentations were conducted at warm temperatures and puched down twice daily in order to encourage maximum extraction of flavors and phenolics.&nbsp; The barrels were purposefully chosen in such a way that their impact would be respectful of the natural terroir with just 20% new oak.&nbsp; The wines then underwent malolactic fermentation in barrel in order to further elevate the mouthfeel.&nbsp; After 13 months of barrel aging, the wines were racked, blended and bottled.&nbsp;<br /><br />The 2020 Claret opens with aromas of blackberry, black cherry and Early Grey.&nbsp; The tea like aroma transfers to the palate with an integrated tannin that is reminiscent of black tea.&nbsp; A light and elegant expression of Bordeaux varieties.&nbsp; The wine finishes with licorice and a tension inducing acidity that satiates and welcomes another sip.&nbsp;</p>
