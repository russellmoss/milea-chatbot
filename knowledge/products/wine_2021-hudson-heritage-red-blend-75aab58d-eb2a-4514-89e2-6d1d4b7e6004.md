## Description
<p><strong>Wine Information<br /><br /></strong>The blend is predominantly Baco noir, followed by Marcheal Foch and a lesser known grape known as Palmer.&nbsp;<br /><br />The fruit was all hand harvested from a small 2.5 acre vineyard here in the Hudson Valley.&nbsp; The grapes were destemmed and a cold soak was conducted at 40F for 3 days in order to extract flavors, color and phenolics.&nbsp; The fermentations were conducted at warm temperatures&nbsp;of 85F in order to retain fruit character while simultaneously&nbsp;extracting&nbsp;<wbr />phenolics and color.&nbsp; Upon the cessation of alcoholic&nbsp;fermentation, the wines were drained, pressed, settled and sent to neutral French Oak barrels.&nbsp; In barrel, the&nbsp;wine was&nbsp;inoculated&nbsp;for malolactic fermentation.&nbsp; The wine was aged in neutral French Oak barrels for 16 months prior to bottling.&nbsp;</p>
