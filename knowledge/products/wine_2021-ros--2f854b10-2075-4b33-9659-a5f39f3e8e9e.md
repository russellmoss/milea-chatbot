## Description
<p>Made by Hudson Valley's 2021 Best Ros&eacute; Winery of the Year.&nbsp; This is THE Ros&eacute; of the Hudson Valley.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Vintage information</strong></p>
<p>2021 was an ideal vintage for New York State.&nbsp; It was warm and dry throughout the growing season.&nbsp; This afforded the vineyards the opportunity to ripen to optimal physiological ripeness, thereby accumulating maximum flavor and phenolics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wine information&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Intentionality is the rallying cry of our production team.&nbsp; With this in mind, blocks are chosen each year for purpose built Ros&eacute;.&nbsp; The grapes are picked so in order to maintain acidity and freshness.&nbsp; The blend of grapes is primarily made up of Hudson Valley's signature red grape, Cabernet Franc, with some other Bordeaux reds making up the bulk of the remainder of the blend.&nbsp; Our winemaker then blends in a small portion of Muscat to provide the wine with a gorgeously upfliting floral aroma.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The wine is fermented to dryness (i.e. withough sugar).&nbsp; This style of Ros&eacute; is meant to fully express the minerality of our glacially derived shale and slate soils.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tasting notes</strong></p>
<p>The wine brims with aromas of orange blossom, lemon, lime, rose petal and a gorgeous minerality.&nbsp; That minerality carries through on the palate, reminiscent of the stone from which our glacially derived soils have been formed.&nbsp; The minerality, combined with the wines fresh acdity provides a mouthwatering experience that we refer to as "la belle salive", leaving you wanting another sip.&nbsp; The wine pairs excellently with oysters, pizza and soft cheeses.&nbsp;</p>
