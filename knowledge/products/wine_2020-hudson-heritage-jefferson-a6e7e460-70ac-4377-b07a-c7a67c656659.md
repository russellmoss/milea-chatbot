## Description
<p><strong>Wine Information</strong></p>
<div dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr">This white wine is made from the heritage grape variety named &ldquo;Jefferson&rdquo; that was bred in Newburgh, N.Y. by J.H. Ricketts in 1874. Jefferson comes from a seed of Concord pollinated by the Hudson Heritage variety Iona. Jefferson is cool climate grape variety that is fungus disease resistant, winter hardy, and productive. This complex and layered white wine has soft labrusca grape flavors that are complemented by elements of melons, white peaches, guava, soft pineapple, and bananas. While fruity, it is a dry and substantial wine with a long clean finish. This is, we believe, to be the first commercially produced 'Jefferson' in the United States and perhaps the world.</div>
