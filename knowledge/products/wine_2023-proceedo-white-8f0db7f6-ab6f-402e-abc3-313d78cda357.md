## Description
<p><strong>Wine Notes</strong></p>
<p>The Proceedo White is crafted from hand-harvested Pinot Noir. The fruit was gently whole-cluster pressed to minimize the extraction of color, bitterness, and astringent compounds. The white wine was then fermented cool in stainless steel tanks before being carefully fined and carbonated tank. The final wine is an elegant expression of a white Pinot Noir, with subtle and entrancing aromas.</p>
