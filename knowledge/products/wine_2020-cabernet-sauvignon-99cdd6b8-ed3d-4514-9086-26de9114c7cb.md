## Description
<p><strong>Vintage information</strong></p>
<p>The 2020 vintage was warm and dry, which allowed our vineyards to perform superbly and afforded Milea Estate access to extremely high quality fruit, especially for red wines.</p>
<p>The Cabernet Sauvignon for this particular offering was sourced primarily from a grower partner on Long Island.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wine information&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The fruit for this wine was destemmed and put directly into small lot fermentation vats.&nbsp; Fermentations were warm and punched down twice daily.&nbsp; The wines were then pressed at dryness and pumped into barrels where they underwent malolactic fermentation and elevage for about 16 months prior to bottling.&nbsp; About 20% new French Oak was used in order to frame the beautiful fruit and pepper aromas.&nbsp;<br /><br />The wine possesses aromas of black fruits and cassis with a hint of black pepper.&nbsp; On the palate, it's medium in body with velvety tannins and a long, crisp finish.&nbsp;</p>
