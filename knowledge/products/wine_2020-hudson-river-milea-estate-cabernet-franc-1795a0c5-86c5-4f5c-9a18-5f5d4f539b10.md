## Description
<p><strong>Vintage information</strong></p>
<p>The 2020 vintage was ideal for reds in New York State, with mostly warm and dry weather throughout the season.&nbsp; This allowed the fruit to achieve physiological ripeness with optimal accumulation of flavors and phenolics.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The fruit for this Hudson River Cabernet Franc was sourced from the Olana Vineyard.&nbsp; The vineyard sits in an idyllic setting along the Hudson River on American Painter, Frederic Church's estate next to the iconic Rip Van Winkle bridge.&nbsp;<br /><br />The soil is a relatively corase textured sandy loam.&nbsp; This allows the vineyard to rapidly drain water.&nbsp; By doing this, the canopies are less dense and the berries are small.&nbsp; This creates a wine of great concentration and density.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wine information</strong></p>
<p>The fruit was de-stemmed and brought straight to small 1 ton bins for a brief cold soak prior to starting fermentation.&nbsp; Fermentation was warm and the musts were punched down twice a day in order to maximize the extraction of flavors and phenolics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wines were drained, pressed and put into barrels where they undertook malolactic fermentation.</p>
<p>The wines underwent elevage in 37% new oak.&nbsp; Just enough oak to frame the fruity and graphite aromas of this stunning wine.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tasting notes</strong></p>
<p>This wine rightly won the accolade of being the best Cabernet Franc in New York state.&nbsp; The aromas are breathtaking, with an intense graphite-like nose, complimented by an abundance of dark plums and raspberries. It lays across the palate with dusty tannins and a beautiful tension inducing acidity and a finish of prodigious length.&nbsp;</p>
