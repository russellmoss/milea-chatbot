## Description
<p data-start="44" data-end="353">Bright, aromatic, and full of character&mdash;our 2024 Vignoles is a rare dry expression of this vibrant grape. 100% estate-grown, this vintage benefited from a season that naturally softened the grape&rsquo;s typically high acidity, allowing us to craft a beautifully balanced wine.</p>
<p data-start="355" data-end="686">Fermented in two separate lots&mdash;with a small percentage of estate Riesling co-fermented for added complexity&mdash;this wine was carefully vinified at cool temperatures to preserve its intense aromatics. Gentle fining during fermentation helped maintain purity of flavor, resulting in a wine that is both lively and nuanced.</p>
<p data-start="688" data-end="917">Notes of tropical pineapple, floral honeysuckle, and a crisp, refreshing finish. With its bright yet balanced acidity, this limited-production Vignoles is a must-try for lovers of unique, cool-climate whites.</p>
