## Description
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wine Information&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>2022 marks the inaugural release of our new Proceedo White which is made 100% from Pinot noir grapes sourced from New York's Niagara Escparpment. Our winemaking team gently pressed the grapes to extract the juice as rapidly as possible from the skins, thereby minimizing color in the final wine. The wine was fermented in stainless steel tanks, where it remained for 4 months prior to bottling.</p>
<p>The winemaking team made this wine in a lightly bubbly frizzante style.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Tasting Notes</strong></p>
<p>The wine starts with aromas of apples, pears, and a slight hint of biscuit. On the palate, these flavors are complimented by small and light bubbles. The acidity is refreshing and the wine finishes with a nice length that makes you want to come back for more.&nbsp;</p>
