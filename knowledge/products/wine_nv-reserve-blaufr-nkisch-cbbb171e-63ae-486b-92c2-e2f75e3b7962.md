## Description
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Wine Notes</strong></p>
<p>Blaufr&auml;nkisch finds its native home in Central Europe and rose to prominence in Austria. We consider it the "Pinot Noir of Central Europe." Like Pinot, Blau is an intoxicating light-bodied red wine with such nuance and depth that it begs you to chase it. Our winemakers are enchanted by its wild and brambly aromas and its delicate phenolic structure.</p>
<p>This Blaufr&auml;nkisch was primarily made from fruit sourced from a vineyard partner in the Erie appellation of New York, as well as fruit from the young vines of the Estate. Our winemakers destemmed the fruit and cold-soaked it for 3 days prior to starting fermentation. The skins were punched down twice a week during a warm fermentation designed to extract the maximum amount of flavor, color, and tannin. The wines were then aged in French oak barrels (10% new) for 14 months prior to bottling.</p>
<p>This special bottling is a blend of the 2022 and 2023 vintages to maximize complexity and showcase the variety regardless of vintage.</p>

<p><strong>Tasting Notes</strong></p>
<p>Opulent aromas of ripe plums, black currants, and blackberries captivate the senses. Behind the fruit, notes of ink, graphite, and delicate vanilla add depth. On the palate, a blend of dried herbs, cola, and black fruits creates a luscious, full-bodied experience, with a finish of tobacco, spice, and dried lavender.</p>
