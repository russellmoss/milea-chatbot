## Description
<p><strong>Wine Information</strong></p>
<div dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr">This wine is a blend of the cool climate grape varieties Le Colonel and Chelois that came to upstate New York by 1955. Both varieties are fungus disease resistant, winter hardy, and productive. Le Colonel was bred by Bertille Seyve, Sr. after 1900 and Chelois was bred by Dr. Albert Seibel just before 1920. Both Seyve and Seibel lived and worked in the Rhone Valley just south of Lyon, France. This aromatic and complex red wine has elements of black cherries, black raspberry jam, and raisins. The jam and black pepper flavors are balanced, with good mouthfeel, a firm, but soft tannin structure, and long clean finish. Chelois&nbsp;is a heritage grape variety as it lead to a boom in the creation of over 15 new wineries in the Hudson Valley from 1965 - 1980 that cultivated this grape variety. During this time period and until very recently, locally made Chelois wines were served at the Culinary Institute of America's Escoffier Room.</div>
