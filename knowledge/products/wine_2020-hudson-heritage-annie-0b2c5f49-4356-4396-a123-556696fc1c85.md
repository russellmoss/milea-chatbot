Our single vine of Annie has now been propagated in sufficient quantities to produce this wine commercially for the first time. This deep red/purple wine has elements of cooked black raspberries, black cherries, raisins, soft black currants, and burnt toast. This is a big wine that has layered flavors red fruit, eucalyptus, lilacs, wet bricks, and a full tannin structure.&nbsp;</p>
