## Description
<p><strong>Wine information</strong></p>
<p>This non-vintage sparkling offering is crafted in a lightly sparkling frizzante style.&nbsp; Our winemaker uses a proprietary blend of grapes consisting of both neutral and aromatic white varieties.&nbsp; The wine is then fermented dry and made in a prosecco style.&nbsp; The wine is "non-vintage" so that the winemaking team can blend previous vintages into the wine in order to provide a wine of consistent style and quality.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tasting notes</strong></p>
<p>This wine gushes with aromas of ripe pears and orange peel.&nbsp; There is also a beautiful lemony undertone that compels you to come back time and time again.&nbsp; The bubbles are light and refreshing and the acid is crisp.&nbsp; Proceedo pairs well with soft cheeses, brussel sprouts and white fish.</p>
