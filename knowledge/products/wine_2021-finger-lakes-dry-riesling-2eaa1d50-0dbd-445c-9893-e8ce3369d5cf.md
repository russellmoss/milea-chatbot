## Description
<p><strong>Wine Information&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The fruit for this Riesling was sourced from a partner vineyard on the West side of Keuka lake.&nbsp; In order to maintain the integrity of the fruit, it was gently hand harvested and transported to our cellar in the Hudson Valley with a refrigerated truck.&nbsp; Upon arrival at the cellar, it was immediately whole cluster pressed and gently settled prior to racking.&nbsp; The juice was then innoculated and fermented at cool temperatures in order to retain aromatic complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to further evolve the flavors, the wine remained in tank for an additional 48 months prior to bottling.&nbsp; The result is an incredibly special offering.&nbsp;</p>
