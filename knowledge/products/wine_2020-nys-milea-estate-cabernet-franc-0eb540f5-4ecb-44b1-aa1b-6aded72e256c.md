## Description
<p><strong>Vintage information</strong></p>
<p>The 2020 vintage was ideal for reds in New York State, with mostly warm and dry weather throughout the season.&nbsp; This allowed the fruit to achieve physiological ripeness with optimal accumulation of flavors and phenolics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fruit from this wine was grown on one of our Long Island sites, Reilly Vineyard.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wine information</strong></p>
<p>The fruit was de-stemmed and brought straight to small 1 ton bins for a brief cold soak prior to starting fermentation.&nbsp; Fermentation was warm and the musts were punched down twice a day in order to maximize the extraction of flavors and phenolics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our winemaking team allows the fruit to macerate on the skins after fermentation and tastes everyday until the phenolics have reached their full maturity.</p>
<p>The wines were drained, pressed and put into barrels where they undertook malolactic fermentation.</p>
<p>The wines underwent elevage in 20% new French oak barrels.&nbsp; The oak regime is respectful of the natural terroir of this wine, really allowing the beauty of Long Island Cabernet Franc to shine through.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tasting notes</strong></p>
<p>The aromas are enrapturing, showing vibrant blackberry, black berry, and plum.&nbsp; On the palate, it is delicate with fresh acidity and silky tannin. It finishes with an elegant flavors of leather, tobcaco and raspberry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
