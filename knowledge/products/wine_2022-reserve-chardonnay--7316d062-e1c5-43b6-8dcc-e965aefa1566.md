## Description
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Vintage &amp; Vineyard Information</strong></p>
<p>2022 was a warm growing season in New York state.&nbsp; This warmth allowed for optimal flavor development and nowhere is this more apparent than in our 2022 Reserve Chardonnay.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />For the 2022 Reserve Chardonnay, our winemaking team used a blend of the best barrels of Chardonnay coming from our Long Island vineyard partners, as well as the Hudson Valley.&nbsp; This allowed a beautiful expression of two distinct natural terroirs.&nbsp; The Chardonnay grown in Deltaic sands of Long Island brings interesting aromas of tropical fruits, whereas the Chardonnay from the Glacial Till of the Hudson Valley brings greater density and minerality.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wine Information</strong></p>
<p>The fruit was whole cluster pressed and the juice was quickly removed from the skin to maintain freshness.&nbsp; The wines were then fermented in 85% neutral oak barrels using yeast that was isolated in Burgundy, France.&nbsp; The 15% of new French oak barrels were purposefully chosen to provide a compliment to the wine while retaining tension. The wines were aged in barrel for 10 months prior to being racked and bottled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2022 Reserve Chardonnay opens with aromas of vanilla and pear.&nbsp; It follows through on the palate with a salinity that is indicative of Long Island Chardonnay, a medium body and tannins to compliment.&nbsp; The wine finishes with spiced apple, vanilla, and a mouthwatering acidity.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>180 cases produced</strong></p>
