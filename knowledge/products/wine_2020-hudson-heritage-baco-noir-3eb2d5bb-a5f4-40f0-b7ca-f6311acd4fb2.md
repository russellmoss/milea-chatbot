<div dir="ltr">
<div>This Baco Noir is a medium bodied red wine that is complex and fruit forward with elements of bramble berries, red cherries, black raspberries, and anise, with hints of eucalyptus, and a soft tannin structure. This grape was developed by Francois Baco of the Armagnac Province, France in 1902 and came to upstate New York by 1955, after being imported from France via Canada just before World War II by the nurseryman Philip Wagner of Boordy Vineyards, Maryland. Baco Noir is a heritage grape variety as it lead to a boom in the creation of over 15 new wineries in the Hudson Valley from 1965 - 1980 that cultivated this grape variety. During this time period, locally made Baco Noir wines were served at the Culinary Institute of America, Escoffier Room, used in course of study for Wine at the CIA, and served at famed restaurants such as the Quilted Giraffe, Bird and Bottle Inn, the Dupuy Canal House, and the Windows on the World Restaurant.</div>
