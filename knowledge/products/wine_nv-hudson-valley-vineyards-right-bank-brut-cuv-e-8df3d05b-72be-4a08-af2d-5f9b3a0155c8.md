## Description
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wine Information&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This is the inaugural release of our Right Bank Brut Cuv&eacute;e. The Right Bank is a nod to the Right Bank of the Gironde estuary in Bordeaux, France. At HVV, we are exploring the great sparkling terroirs of the United States, by making wine from vineyards in New York (Right Bank) and Oregon (Left Bank).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot noir sourced from Long Island, the fruit was harvested in 2020 and fermented in stainless steel tanks to maintain the integrity of the terroir. The wine spent 18 months in bottle prior to disgorgement in June of 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Tasting Notes</strong></p>
<p>The Right Bank Brut Cuv&eacute;e opens with aromas of citrus, pear, and apple and follows through on the palate, adding a hint of fresh toast. The effervescence is long-lasting and the finish is mouthwatering. We are very excited by this first release. An exciting future is in store for Hudson Valley Vineyards.&nbsp;</p>
