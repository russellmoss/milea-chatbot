Consequently, this allowed us to source more fruit from our trusted vineyard partners on Long Island, which wasn't impacted by the frost.</span></div>

<p>The fruit was whole cluster pressed and the juice was quickly removed from the skin to maintain freshness.&nbsp; The wines were then fermented in 85% neutral oak barrels using yeast that was isolated in Burgundy, France.&nbsp; The 15% of new French oak barrels were purposefully chosen to provide a compliment to the wine while retaining tension. The wines were aged in barrel for 10 months prior to being racked and bottled.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tasting Notes</strong></p>
<p>The 2023 Reserve Chardonnay opens with aromas of vanilla and pear.&nbsp; It follows through on the palate with a salinity that is indicative of Long Island Chardonnay, a medium body and tannins to compliment.&nbsp; The wine finishes with spiced apple, vanilla, and a mouthwatering acidity.&nbsp;</p>
