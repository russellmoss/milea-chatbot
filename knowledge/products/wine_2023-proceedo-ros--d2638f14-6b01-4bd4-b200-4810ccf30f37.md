## Description
<p><strong>Wine Notes</strong></p>
<p>The Proceedo Ros&eacute; is a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot followed by two rare and highly sustainable varieties, Chambourcin and Vidal blanc. The grapes were hand harvested in order to maintain freshness. The<br />reds underwent a process known as saignee in which the tanks were bled off soon after filling in order to concentrate the resulting red wine, the juice that was pulled of is pink in color and was fermented cool. The still wines were carefully blended by our winemaking team and then carbonated in tank in order to preserve the aromas and livliness of the<br />wine.</p>
