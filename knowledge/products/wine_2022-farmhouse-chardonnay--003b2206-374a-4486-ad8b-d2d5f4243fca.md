## Description
<p><strong>Vintage and vineyard informatoin</strong></p>
<p>2022 was a warm vintage, which allowed for very flavorful wines and the Farmhouse Chardonnay is no exception.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fruit for this wine was sourced from a vineyard partner on the North Fork of Long Island.&nbsp; Grown on deltaic sands, the Chardonnay's of Long Island tend to express themselves in a more tropcial fruited direction that those grown in the glacial till found in the Hudson Valley.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wine information&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The grapes were whole cluster pressed in order to minimize the extraction of phenolics.&nbsp; Then the juice was fermented in stainless steel tanks in order to respect the integrity of the natural terroir.&nbsp; This Chardonnay is unoaked, having been in tank for 5 months prior to bottling.&nbsp; The result is a lively wine with fresh aromas of tropical fruits and a refreshing acidity.&nbsp; A saline character, indicative of Long Island Chardonnay, carries through on the finish.&nbsp;</p>

## Quick Overview
