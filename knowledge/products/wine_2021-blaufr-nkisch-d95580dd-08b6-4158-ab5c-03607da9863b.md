## Description
<p><strong>Wine information</strong></p>
<p>Blaufr&auml;nkisch finds it's native home in Central Europe and rose to prominence in Austria.&nbsp; We consider it the "Pinot noir of Central Europe".&nbsp; Like with Pinot, Blau is an intoxicating light bodied red wine that has such nuiance and depth that it begs you to chase it.&nbsp; Our winemakers are enchanted by it's wild and brambly aromas and it's delicate phenolic structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Blaufr&auml;nkisch was primarily made from fruit sourced from a vineyard parter in the Erie appelation of New York, as well as some fruit from the young vines of the Estate.&nbsp; Our winemakers destemmed the fruit and cold soaked for 3 days prior to starting fermentation.&nbsp; The skins were punched down twice a week during a warm fermentation that was designed to extract the maximum amount of flavor, color and tannin.&nbsp; The wines were then aged in French Oak barrels (10% new) for 14 months prior to bottling.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tasting notes</strong></p>
<p>True to form, the wine starts with aromas of blackberry and dark cherry.&nbsp; It carries these flavors through to the palate, adding an additional layer of chocolate and allspice.&nbsp; The wine has a medium body with granular tannins that are buoyed by a fresh acidity.&nbsp; The finish is long and the spice lingers.&nbsp; The wine evolves beautifully in the glass.&nbsp; This is variety is a particular favorite of our winemaking team.&nbsp;</p>
