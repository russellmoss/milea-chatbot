## Description
<p><strong>Wine and vineyard information</strong></p>
<p>The fruit for this Pinot noir was primarily soured from one of our long term partnering vineyards in New York's Niagara Escparment.&nbsp; This special wine marks the final vintage of the Milea Estate Pinot noir.&nbsp; Don't despair, Milea Family Wines will continue to make Pinot noir at it's new property opening in 2024, Hudson Valley Vineyards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wine was made using Burgundian techniques such as cold soaks, twice daily punch downs and 14 months of aging in neutral oak in order to fully express the nuanced beauty of the natual terroir from which the fruit originated.&nbsp; This resulted in an elegant and delicate expression of Pinot Noir with raspberry, cherry and wet earth.&nbsp;</p>
