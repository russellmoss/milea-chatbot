## Description
<p><strong>Vintage information</strong></p>
<p>2021 was an excellent year for grapegrowing in New York state.&nbsp; The Gr&uuml;ner Veltliner for this wine was sourced from a vineyard near Lake Erie.&nbsp; The proximity to the lake creates a moderate grape growing climate that allows the fruit to reliably reach full maturity by the end of the growing season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Wine information</strong></p>
<p>The fruit for this Gr&uuml;ner Veltliner were destemmed prior to pressing in order to create a delectable mouthfeel and a structured wine that pairs well with food.&nbsp; The juice was fermented cool in stainless steel tanks in order to retain freshness and minerality.&nbsp; With freshness retention in mind, the wine was bottled soon upon the cessation of fermentation.&nbsp;<br /><br />The wine exudes aromas of lemon, orange, white pepper and a hint of apricot, much like the Gr&uuml;ner Veltliners of it's native home. The wine is light, dry and presents with a mineral acidity.&nbsp;</p>
