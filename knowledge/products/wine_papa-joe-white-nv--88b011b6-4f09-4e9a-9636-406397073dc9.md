## Description
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wine Information</strong></p>
<p>This wine is an homage to Joseph Milea, our founder's father. Joe was an approachable and gregarious man. Our winemakers seek to capture Joe's soulful essence in this offering.</p>
<p>The Papa Joe White is primarily made from Heritage grapes that have a long history of use in New York and the Hudson Valley. The result is an extremely approachable white wine that overflows with aromas of apricots, guava, and papaya. Papa Joe has a gentle acidity and makes an extremely nice cocktail wine on its own.</p>
<p>No matter where you go, if you bring Papa Joe, you'll be the life of the party.&nbsp;</p>
