## Description
<p><strong>Wine information</strong></p>
<p>Proceedo Ros&eacute; is purposefully crafted by our winemaking team, using mostly Cabernet Franc, Pinot Noir and a small amount of Muscat.&nbsp; The wine is effusively floral on the nose being accompanied by supporting aromas of wet stone and white peach.&nbsp; On the palate, the wine is dry, light, bubbly and linear with a refreshing acidity.&nbsp; It's an absolute local crowd pleaser, especially during the warmer months.&nbsp;</p>

## Quick Overview
A lightly bubbly frizzante style of sparkling wine that overflows with aromas of white flowers, wet stone and white peach.  A summer favorite for many Hudsonians.
