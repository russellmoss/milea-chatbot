<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2021 Farmhouse BDX Red Blend takes center stage, artfully blending fruits primarily sourced from the Hudson River Region and Long Island. This lighter expression of a Bordeaux blend enthralls the senses with enticing aromas of black currant and black cherry, interwoven with delicate nuances of leather and a hint of violet. On the palate, its silky tannins meld seamlessly with a fresh acidity, unveiling a captivating interplay. As the wine evolves, it leaves a delightful, lingering finish of vibrant acidity and subtle notes of cola.</span></p>
