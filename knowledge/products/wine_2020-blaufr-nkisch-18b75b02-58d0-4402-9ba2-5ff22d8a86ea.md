## Description
<p><strong>Vintage information</strong></p>
<p>The fruit for this extraordinaryily vibrant expression of Blaufr&auml;nkisch was sourced from a vineyard located near the shore of Lake Erie.&nbsp; The lake moderates the temperatures, which allows for optimal ripeness of the fruit year in and year out.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The 2020 vintage was warm and dry, which allowed our vineyards to perform superbly and allowed Milea Estate access to extremely high quality fruit, especially for red wines.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wine information</strong></p>
<p>The grapes for this wine were hand harvested to ensure their physical integrity and quality from vineyard to winery.&nbsp; The grapes were destemmed and fermented warm with punchdowns twice a day to ensure maximum extraction of flavors and phenolics.&nbsp; The wine spent 13 months in neutral French Oak barrels in order to preserve the natural terroir and character of the fruit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blaufr&auml;nkisch is considered the Pinot Noir of Central Europe and finds it's native home in Austria.&nbsp; At Milea, we consider ourselves a "Blauhaus" (Bauhaus pun intended).&nbsp; This grape is particularly well suited for the soils and climate of New York State.&nbsp; Our expression of Blaufr&auml;nkisch shows beautiful aromas of blackberries and raspberries.&nbsp; The black pepper like aromas compliment the very fruity nose.&nbsp; On the palate, the wine is light to medium bodied with fine grained tannins and a bright acidity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only 55 cases produced</p>
