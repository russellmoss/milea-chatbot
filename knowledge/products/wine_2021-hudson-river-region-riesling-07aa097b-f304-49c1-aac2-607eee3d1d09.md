## Description
<p><strong>Vintage information</strong></p>
<p>2021 was an excellent year for grapegrowing in New York state.&nbsp; With a warm growing season, our Hudson River Region Riesling was afforded an abundance of heat and sunlight that allowed it to achieve optimal ripeness.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wine information</strong></p>
<p>The fruit for this selection was entirely hand picked in order to maintain fruit integrity from vineyard to cellar.&nbsp; It was then destemmed and pressed in order to achieve ideal phenolic extraction that would lead to a food friendly structure.&nbsp; The wine was fermented cool in stainless steel tanks and bottled soon after fermentation.&nbsp;<br /><br />The 2021 Hudson River Region Riesling bursts forth from the glass with aroams of jasmine and white peach.&nbsp; This aroma continues on the palate, along with phenolic ripeness and a crisp acidity and long finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

## Quick Overview
