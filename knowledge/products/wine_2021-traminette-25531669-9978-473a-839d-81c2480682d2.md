## Description
<p><strong>Vintage information</strong></p>
<p>2021 was an ideal vintage for New York State.&nbsp; It was warm and dry throughout the growing season.&nbsp; This afforded the vineyards the opportunity to ripen to optimal physiological ripeness, thereby accumulating maximum flavor.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Traminette, an heirloom variety, produces enchantingly aromatic wines, all while sustainably holding up to NY's climate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wine information</strong></p>
<p>The fruit for this wine was almost exclusively sourced from the Milea Estate.&nbsp; The grapes were destemmed prior to pressing in order to produce a wine with body that will hold up to food.&nbsp; The juice was fermented cool in order to retain the delicate floral volatile aromas of this effusive aromatic white.&nbsp; The wines were bottled soon after the cessation of fermentation in order to capture the true essence of this wine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wine shows a gorgeous bouquet of lychee, apricot and honey.&nbsp; On the palate, it's light with a crisp acidity and long finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

## Quick Overview
A beguiling aroma of lychee, apricot and honey with a lightness of ease across the palate and a crisp acidic finish.  A refreshing wine for lovers of dry aromatic white wines.
