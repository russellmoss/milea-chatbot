## Description
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wine Information</strong></p>
<p>Proceedo Ros&eacute; is purposefully crafted by our winemaking team, using mostly Cabernet Franc, Pinot Noir, and a small amount of Muscat.&nbsp; The wine is made in a frizzante style which is lightly carbonated.&nbsp;<br /><br />The wine opens with aromas of papaya, raspberry and citrus.&nbsp; On the palate, the bubbles are small and light, bringing forward a fresh acidity that carries through on the finish.</p>

## Quick Overview
A lightly bubbly frizzante style of sparkling wine that overflows with aromas of white flowers, wet stone and white peach.  A summer favorite for many Hudsonians.
