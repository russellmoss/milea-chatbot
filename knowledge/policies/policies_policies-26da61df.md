Please note: Although we use our best efforts to protect the security of your information and our system, and we have agreements in place with our service providers requiring them to do the same, no transmission via the internet or storage of data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result of this and other factors beyond our control, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you transmit to or through our website. Therefore, you assume that risk by using this, or any other website. 

Additionally, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your devices and personal records in your home, office, etc. Milea Estate Vineyard is not liable for any damage that may arise due to the release of information from your own computer, phone, other digital devices, or other personal records.**How We Share Your Information**We work with service providers and third parties to assist us to fulfill our sales and services to you and to process your data. Those third parties include shipping companies, data hosts, credit card processors, and email management companies, which host our databases, ship orders, process credit cards, bill users for goods and services. We require all such service providers and third parties to keep any information they receive confidential, maintain the privacy of all our customers, and to use any customer information solely to provide services on behalf of us and you.

From time to time, we may also employ other companies and individuals to perform services, such as to maintain and operate the website, and to maintain certain features on the website. To such parties, we may disclose non-personal information such as traffic patterns and website usage data.

We also may employ service providers and third parties to analyze our sales data for internal purposes, in which case we may disclose information to such parties such as the wines purchased, the location of shipment, and the frequency of purchases. We may also enlist a service provider or third party to assist with marketing and sending member emails, in which case we will provide these third party vendors only with member email addresses. Again, we require all such service providers and third parties to keep any information they receive confidential, maintain the privacy of all our customers, and to use any information provided for services on our and your behalf.

This site may contain links to other websites, for example when we are sharing information about an event venue. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites.

This site does not track information from users through cookies if a “do not track” signal is received.**Data of Minors**This website is not directed at minors and our products cannot be accessed by persons who do not verify that they are of legal drinking age.
