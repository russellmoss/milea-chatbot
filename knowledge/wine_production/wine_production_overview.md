# Milea Estate Vineyard Wine Production

## Our Winemaking Philosophy

At Milea Estate Vineyard, we are dedicated to producing wines that authentically express the unique terroir of New York State. Our winemaking philosophy emphasizes minimal intervention, allowing the inherent qualities of the grapes to shine through. We believe that exceptional wine begins in the vineyard, and this principle guides every aspect of our production process.

## Vineyard Sources

### Estate Vineyards

Our 17-acre estate vineyard in the Hudson Valley is meticulously managed to cultivate grape varieties well-suited to our specific soils and climate. We practice sustainable farming methods, with tightly spaced plantings that encourage deep root development, resulting in fruit with distinctive character and complexity.

### Regional Partnerships

In addition to our estate-grown grapes, we partner with small, sustainably farmed vineyards in other winegrowing regions of New York State, including:

- Long Island vineyards
- Lake Erie region growers
- Select Finger Lakes vineyards

These collaborations allow us to vinify grape varieties that thrive in different terroirs, broadening the diversity and complexity of our wine offerings while maintaining our commitment to New York State viticulture.

## Production Methods

### Minimal Intervention Approach

Our approach to winemaking is to use minimal intervention and let the grapes speak for themselves. We don't just say wine is made in the vineyard; for us, it's a fundamental principle that shapes our entire production process.

### Fermentation Techniques

- **White Wines, Sparkling & Rosé**: Fermented at cooler temperatures to preserve their aromatic freshness and fruit-forward character
- **Barrel-Fermented Chardonnay**: Allowed to ferment at slightly warmer temperatures, enhancing mouthfeel and enabling the grape's full expression
- **Red Wines**: Carefully monitored fermentation with gentle extraction methods to preserve fruit character while developing appropriate structure

### Thoughtful Oak Integration

Our approach to oak usage is decidedly conservative and thoughtful:

- **Single-Vineyard Red Wines**: Maximum 35% new French oak for wines designed for aging
- **Farmhouse Collection Reds**: Approximately 10-15% new French oak
- **Oak Selection**: Tight-grained, medium-toasted oak for reds; tight-grained, lightly toasted oak for whites
- **Philosophy**: Oak should act as a supporting element—like the frame of a painting that enhances without overwhelming the artwork itself

### Yeast Selection

The yeasts we use are specially chosen to showcase the terroir clearly from vineyard to glass:

- **Selected Yeasts**: Primary fermentation typically uses carefully selected yeasts that highlight varietal character
- **Limited Natural Fermentation**: While we appreciate indigenous yeasts and use them selectively, we employ them judiciously to ensure the most accurate representation of New York State terroirs

## Sustainability Practices

### Environmental Commitment

We integrate aspects of natural and biodynamic winemaking techniques into our process. This holistic approach considers the vineyard as a living organism, promoting biodiversity and ecological balance.

### Certifications and Recognition

- **New York Vineyard Sustainability Certification**: Our vineyard practices meet the rigorous standards of the New York State sustainability program
- **Slow Food "Snail of Approval"**: Recognition of our commitment to sustainable, environmentally responsible production methods
