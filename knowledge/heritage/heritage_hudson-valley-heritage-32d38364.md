# Hudson Valley Heritage Wines

## Overview

The Hudson Valley Heritage Grape Project is a living vine library, conserving indigenous grape varieties and historic grape cultivars bred primarily in the 19th century. These heritage varieties are hybrids of European and Native American origin that thrive in the Hudson Valley climate and can be grown in an environmentally sustainable manner.

## About the Project

Milea Estate Vineyard promotes this project through our Hudson Valley Heritage Wines collection. These bottlings are modern-day interpretations of the historic grape varieties of centuries past.
