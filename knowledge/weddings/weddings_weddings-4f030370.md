Clubhouse Fee: $10,000 – $15,000 (season-dependent).

How many guests can the venue comfortably accommodate?

Our Clubhouse can accommodate up to 120 guests for a seated dinner, or 150 for cocktail hour, while still accommodating a dance floor inside. We can seat up to 160 without the dance floor.

What time does my event need to end?

The town of Clinton has a noise ordinance of 8pm for any outdoor music. But fear not, you are welcome to keep the party going until 11pm inside.

Can we have an afterparty?

We offer after parties for an additional cost until 1am.

What happens in case of inclement weather?

We have you covered with an outdoor pergola that has roofing, retractable screens, heaters, and fans. No matter the weather, the clubhouse can host your entire event inside. Your events team will have a rain plan ready for you if the ceremony or cocktail hour are outside.

Important to note, we do not have tenting or portable heaters. We are happy to provide you with companies who can accommodate these requests for you.

Where do my guests park?

Onsite parking – in the parking lot we can host up to 60 cars. Guests are also welcome to park along our driveway which can host another 60 cars or at our farm across the street from the vineyard.

Are my guests allowed to smoke on property?

We are proud to be a smoke free property. Smoking is not allowed indoors as per federal regulations. Smoking locations can be established on the property for your event. Excessive cigarette butts on the ground may incur an additional cleaning fee.

Is Milea pet friendly?

We do love our four legged friends but we kindly ask that they remain leashed both inside and outside. Grapes are unsafe for dogs to consume and we want to make sure they are protected. We appreciate your understanding in this matter.

Is Milea wheelchair accessible?

Yes.

Am I required to have my own event coordinator or planner?

Yes. The planner could be with you the entire time you are planning your event or just for the day on site. The planner or coordinator is required to be from a legitimate business and must be chosen at least 2 months prior to the day of the wedding.

I want to bring my own décor. Do you have any limitations on what I can use?

Any and all installs or decorations must be approved by our events coordinator. Any installation times must be approved at least seven days before the event. No outside furniture, lighting, floral, sound systems, etc are allowed without prior approval

There is absolutely no confetti, glitter, seeds, or rice allowed. There will be an additional $500 cleaning fee applied if any of these are found to be in use.

Am I responsible for cleaning up after?

Milea has a dedicated events team to make sure your day is stress free. This includes cleaning up after your event. Any excessive clean up or trash removal from events or vendors will be billed to the party hosts at $500 per hour of needed clean up.

What is the price of food and beverage?

The Paddock, our starting food package is $185 per person. This includes salad, two entrees, two sides, with coffee and tea

The Trot, our starting bar package is $60 per person. This includes your choice of five Milea Estate Vineyard Farmhouse collection wines.

All catering is subject to a 8.125% sales tax and a 25% service fee.

Are there upgrades available to the menu options?

Plated style service is an additional $35 per person.

If I want something that is off menu or to modify your menu, am I allowed to do so?

Yes! Our talented culinary team is able to accommodate modifications and requests. If you want a menu inspired by culture heritage or just your favorite foods, please speak with our events coordinator to see what we can do for you.

Menu modifications of equal value would not be at any additional costs.

Do you offer any menu or wine tastings before my event?

Absolutely we do! We encourage you to come in and try our food and wine to help you select your favorites. Dinner menu and wine tastings are for an additional fee and are optional but encouraged.

Can we host our rehearsal dinner and / or welcome party with Milea?

Absolutely! We offer a 10% discount on our site fee if you host both events with us.

Do you have a preferred vendor list?

We do have vendors that we recommend to our clients but you are not required to stick within that list. All vendors are required to show proof of insurance, (a COI – certificate of insurance), of $1M.

Do you have any restrictions on what vendors I use?

Our events team would be happy to share our list with you or talk you through any specific requests.

When are my vendors allowed to arrive to Milea? When do they need to have clean up and finished?

Typically we say they may start to arrive as early as 9 am the day of your event. Should we not have an event the day prior, early set up may be allowed on a case by case basis. Please check with our events team for more details. Vendors need to have everything removed from property by 12pm the following day. 

Am I allowed to bring in outside catering for my event?

Yes, outside caterers are allowed and are considered a vendor, so all vendor rules apply to them as well. Outside caterers are allowed use of the kitchen space and kitchen equipment such as stove, oven, and refrigerator. Caterers are NOT permitted to using any of our pots, pans, plates, flatware, glasses, stemware, or linens.

Is there lodging available on property?

Milea has a private residence waiting for you! 

The Staatsburg house is a 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom turn of the century farmhouse with a pool, fireplace, new luxury kitchen, TVs, AC/heat, and is located across the street from the vineyard.

All bedrooms can sleep two.

Do you recommend any accommodations for my guests?

Yes, we are a company that invests in our local communities and work closely with multiple hotels and inns in our area. Our events team would be happy to provide you with a vendor list. 

## I am ready!  
How do I book?

A signed contract and a deposit of 50% of the site fee are required to secure your date. The entire balance of your event is due in full 30 days from your event. Any changes made during the 30 days leading up to your event must be approved by the events coordinator and/or executive chef and must be paid for no later than 2 days after a change is made. No changes to the event are allowed within 7 days of the event.
