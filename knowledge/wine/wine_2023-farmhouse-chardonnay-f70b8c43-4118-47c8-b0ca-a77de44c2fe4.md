## Description
<p><strong>Wine Notes</strong></p>
<p>In 2023, upstate New York experienced a severe frost, which dramatically lowered yields. Consequently, this allowed us to source more fruit from our trusted vineyard partners on Long Island, which wasn't impacted by the frost. This is the case for this unoaked expression. The fruit for this wine was sourced from a vineyard partner on the North Fork of Long Island. Grown on deltaic sands, the Chardonnays of Long Island tend to express themselves in a more tropical-fruited direction, and this wine is no exception. The Farmhouse Chardonnay was fermented cool entirely in stainless steel tanks to maintain the integrity of the fruit and allow for a pure expression. Lees stirring was conducted briefly to broaden the mouthfeel.</p>

<p><strong>Tasting Notes</strong></p>
<p>The wine opens with aromas of green apple and quince. On the palate, it bounds forth with lively acidity and a medium body, accompanied by flavors of brioche. The wine finishes with a salivating salinity, indicative of Chardonnay grown on Long Island due to its proximity to the ocean.</p>
