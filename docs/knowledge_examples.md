## Content Guidelines for Markdown Files

For each markdown file, I recommend including:

1. **Clear Headings**: Use H1 for the document title, H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections
2. **Factual Information**: Focus on concrete facts rather than marketing language
3. **Structured Data**: Use bullet points and numbered lists where appropriate
4. **Keywords**: Include relevant terms people might search for
5. **Contextual Details**: Include dates, specific varieties, and other precise information

These documents will provide a comprehensive knowledge base for your chatbot to draw from when answering customer queries, resulting in more accurate and helpful responses across all aspects of your vineyard business.
